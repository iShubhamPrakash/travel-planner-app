# Evaluate a news article with Natural Language Processing

This project uses Natural Language Processing to evaluate the articles.

I have used AYLIEN TEXT ANALYSIS API. It is a Natural Language Processing for Effective Understanding of Human-Generated Text.

It gives us the extract meaning and insight from textual content with ease.

## What is Natural Language Processing

Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**

This project uses AYLIEN TEXT ANALYSIS API. To run this project locally, you'll need API keys which you can get from [here](https://developer.aylien.com/signup)

To avoid the misuse of my API keys I have not provided my own API keys. You'll have to signup and get your own API key
and create a .env file as follow-

`

A file ".env" must be present at the root of the project containing following environment variables-

```

API_ID = your_id
API_KEY = your_key
PORT = 8000

```
